To provide a comprehensive report, I'll carry out the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and clean unusual entries.
Descriptive Statistics: Provide summary statistics for the numerical columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform analysis to uncover trends and insights.
Visualizations: Create relevant visualizations to support the analysis.
Report Compilation: Compile the analysis and visualizations into a detailed report.
Let's start with data cleaning.

The data cleaning process is complete. Now, let's move on to the next steps: performing descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating visualizations, and compiling the report.

Descriptive Statistics
I'll start by providing summary statistics for the numerical columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I'll conduct some analysis to uncover trends and insights in the data.

Visualizations
I'll create relevant visualizations to support the analysis.

Report Compilation
Finally, I'll compile the analysis and visualizations into a detailed report.

Let's begin with descriptive statistics and then proceed to EDA. ​​

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Next, I'll perform some EDA to uncover trends and insights in the data. This includes analyzing relationships between different variables and their impact on car price and total salary. ​
